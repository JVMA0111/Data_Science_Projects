## 🔄 ETL Pipeline Stages

### 1️⃣ Extract
- Data is extracted from raw data sources (CSV files / datasets).
- Initial inspection is performed to understand data structure and quality.

### 2️⃣ Transform
- Data cleaning and preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values
  - Renaming columns for clarity
  - Type conversions
  - Removing inconsistencies and duplicates
- Feature selection and transformation to improve usability.

### 3️⃣ Load
- Transformed data is stored in a structured format.
- Final dataset is in csv file and ready to use.
